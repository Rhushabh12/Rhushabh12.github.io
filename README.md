## Hosting a Resume on static site

### Purpose
The purpose of this README is to explain how to host and format a resume in a markdown file using software like GitHub pages, and Jekyll. The language that we will be using for formatting our resume is the markup language. I will using the general principles of current Technical Writing, which is explained in Andrew Etter’s book “Modern Technical Writing”. 

### Prerequisites 
*	A resume formatted in Markdown.


### Instructions, including animated GIF

*	#### GitHub Pages
    * **Account creation and creating a repository.**
        1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
        2. Create a new repository, the name of the repository should be in this “Git_user_name.gitgub.io” format. The user name can be found from the right-top cornor. However, if you are not able to find, how to access your repository. Logo: ![Drop down button] (https://github.com/Rhushabh12/Rhushabh12.github.io/blob/main/logo.JPG"drop_down_button") check for this logo in your screen. When pressing it will show a dropdown menue, look for "your repositories" option. This will take you to your repositories, then press on ![new repo](https://github.com/Rhushabh12/Rhushabh12.github.io/blob/main/new_repo.JPG"new_button") this button. 
        3. After you enter a username, you can put some description for this repository if you want as it is optional. 
        4. Set this repository public as when any employer wants to see your resume, they can access it.
        5. then the last option is to add a readme file, you just must check the box which says, “ADD a README file”.
        6. Then the last step is to create it by clicking on the button “create repository”.
    *	**Adding your resume to the git-hub** 
        *	There are a few ways for adding and creating a file on git-hub I will be showing one easy way.
            *  	Creating from git-hub 
                1.  Open the repository that we created, there is a option available on the top right corner of git-hub, press on that circle then you will see a list of options. Click on “your repositories” and it will take you to all of your repositories.
                2.	Go to the repository that we created, now in the repository, there are many options do not get confused by that we will be only using few. 
                3.	Navigate the green color Code button and on the left side of that there is “add file” button form where you can add the file.  
                4.	You can either upload your markdown file or create one then later edit it (refer to the next heading).
    *	**Option for formatting or editing on GitHub pages**
        1.	In the repository click on the file you want you want to edit or format.
        2.	Navigate the pencil icon on the screen, which will be on right had side of the screen below the “go to file” button.
        3.	Mouseover that icon and it will say edit this file.
        4.	After clicking on that edit button, it will take you to the edit page.
        5.	On this page there are few good options available, the default screen will show you the edit file screen.
        6.	The first thing we will need is to name the file. There is a dialogue box that says “Name your file…” click there. Now there are few different formats that we need to keep in mind. For resume, the name of the file should be index.md, the README file should be the standard all caps README.md and the last file which we will need is “yml” format file which I will be explaining in the Jekyll part.  
        7.	Besides the edit file option there is a preview option for instance, if we do the formatting in markdown then we can see how it will be viewed on the screen in that preview option.
*	#### Jekyll
    Static websites are good, it does not have any installation, no database, and nothing to install. There are many static site generators that exist, we will be using I am using Jekyll which is also suggested by Andrew Etter.
    1.	The first step is to create a file named “_config.yml”. you can just copy-paste the name while creating as the naming part is very important in Jekyll. 
    2.	In the _config.yml file you will see a line of code, that code for theme purpose. After we are done with all the steps, you will be able to see the resume on a static site, without the yml file there will be no theme.
    3.	When you are done with creating the yml file last thing is to check all the file names.
    4.	Even if you have named it something else it can be changed by editing the file (refer to the “Option for formatting or editing on GitHub pages”).

*	#### Last checking
    1.	Name of the repository “git_user_name.github.io” in this format.
    2.	Resume is in the file named “index.md”.
    3.	The name of the yml file is “_config.yml”.
*	#### Running 
    1.	Copy the name of the repository and paste in it on any browser (search URL) and now the resume can be seen on the site.
